 Rocket_Elevators_Media_Streamer

About Week 10 - The marketing department at Rocket Elevators has long been waiting for the opportunity to do media content placement in the company's elevators. To meet their needs, we implement a content delivery module.

This module:

- Reusable library. (in the 'lib' directory of your information system.)
- The TDD is made by using RSpec ( http://rspec.info )
- All the content available and accessible via the getContent method.

Media source:

- Open Weather API: https://openweathermap.org/api

For testing:

- Test command: rspec ./spec/lib/streamer_spec.rb

Unit tests (3 tests):

- File: ./spec/interventions_controller_spec.rb
